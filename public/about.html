<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, My name is Adrian Hudson. I come from a small town in Texas called Mexia with no more then 8,000 people. Growing up I fell in love with three things: Art, basketball and technology.Throughout my teen years, I would play basketball everyday, nonstop. On weekends, My friend and I would go to his house, play video games on his computer and draw all day. Thats when I first fell in love with computers and technology.</p>

<p>I remember when my parents bought our first computer, I would spend so much time learning about the differnet programs and how everthing worked. It was like love at first sight. As I grew older and started highschool, I focuesd more on developing my basketball skills. I really wanted to play overseas, but that dream fell short. I then considered pursuing compter science in college, but  I got discouraged because so many people told me I couldn't do it. Instead of listening to myself, I listened to them and started taking my art more serious. I drew everyday and got really good at it, but I always felt like something was missing. </p>

<p>Ten years later, I realized that art wasn't going to take me where I wanted to go. So, I jumped into the technology field, and I'm loving every bit of it. Becoming a self taught programmer is really challenging but I love it. I love the feeling of figuring out complex problems, it really gives me a rush. I aspire  to become a great programmer one day. I think that my skill set will be a great addition to any team that gives me an chance.  </p>
